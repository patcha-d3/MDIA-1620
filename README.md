**3 AHA Moments**
- String - data type is a sequence of characters, quotation marks needed, for example: let horseName = "BlahBlah";
- Number - is a numerical data, type-no quotations needed, for example: let horseAge = 999;
- Boolean - logical data type, can only be true or false, prefix is "is", "can", "has", for example: let isHorseInside = true;

**2 Things that are still unclear**
- When I tried to edit horseName to other name and saved, VSCode just got mad and showed the ReferenceError
- What does 'boolean' do? or it just to check true or false?

**1 Word for how you're feeling:**
- Feeling like a newbie programmer, I learned how to publish my codes to GitHub by not uploading on GitHub website.

**Note**
git status - shows the status of your files
git add *filename* - to add file for uploading
git push - to upload files on GitHub
